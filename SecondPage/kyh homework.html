                        <dd>Hello, I'm from brazil and I'm sorry if there is anything wrong in this text, I just wanted to make my tribute to Mr. Jobs. I can say he chaged my life, 'cause I have an iPod (something very usefull for me and makes me happy). I really don't know that to say, there must be lots of e-mails more beautiful than this one, but I would like to thank him and Apple for everything.</dd>

                        <dt>Thanks</dt>
                        <dd>So grateful Steve Jobs was in my lifetime. Hard to imagine that someone could make technological companions (more than just tools) that are equally loved by me (very non tech) and my husband (very high tech). Gave us so much. Sending this note to acknowledge his impact and send condolences to his family.</dd>

                        <dd>Steve has touched the lives of so many. He will truly be missed. He revolutionized the world for us all. The world will never be the same, and it is a detriment for all of us to have lost him so early.</dd>

                        <dt>A genius man</dt>
                        <dd>Steve jobs was a person I admired I constantly watch his forever amazing and iconic keynotes announcing the greatest products ever made. His commencement speech at Stanford it's something that reminds how life works and the key to succeed. Steve founded my most favorite animation film studios Pixar there isn't a single thing I don't like about Pixar and there is nothing I enjoyed more than watching their instant classic movies that will be with us forev er. He is truly the Da Vinci of our time and in my opinion there isn't going to be someone like him in a very very long time because the greatest minds don't come so often and I think everyone agrees that Steve changed the world; he changed the way we think of computers, mobile devices and music. I always thought of him as the greatest speaker of all time and I would like to hear him again in an apple event. He will always be my inspiration and his words will be in my way of thinking my entire life. My regards to is family, close friends and at Apple and I hope you follow his thoughts of perfection to make more great products that the whole world is eager to see. Thank You for your inspiration and Thank You for everything you've accomplished.</dd>

                        <dd>I was weaned on the "Lisa" in the 80's, grew up with the Mac in the 90's and have since been spoiled with the "i"'s - pod, pad, phone and book. Steve Jobs made work easy, computers fun and technology intuitive. We are all sad today, but grateful for what he was able to do in his short time here. My condolences to his family.</dd>
